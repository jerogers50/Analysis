This repo contains four files:
===============================================================================================
1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md
3. run_analysis.R
4. tidy_data.txt

The README file provides a list of files in the repo and a descreption of how each file works and is related

The CodeBook markdown file describes the variables, the data, and work performed to clean up the data

The run_analysis script does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The tidy_data text file contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
